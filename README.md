# # Project: CoPilot-Driven VS Code Theme Generator
## Overview
This project enables users to integrate GitHub CoPilot with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to dynamically create and customize themes based on natural language instructions. By leveraging a predefined color palette and natural language processing, users can describe their desired theme (e.g., "gloomy" or "silent night"), and the system will generate a matching VS Code theme.


## Features

- Natural Language Theme Creation: Generate themes by describing the desired aesthetic in plain language.

- Dynamic Color Palette: Automatically assigns colors based on mood or descriptive keywords.

- VS Code Integration: Seamless application of the generated theme to the user's VS Code environment.

- Customizable Palettes: Extend or modify the color palette to suit individual preferences.

## Reuirements 
- Visual Studio Code

- GitHub CoPilot extension

- Node.js (for running scripts)

- JSON file support for theme generation
## Installation

> Clone the repository:
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/copilot-vscode-theme.git
cd copilot-vscode-theme
```
> Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
> Ensure GitHub CoPilot is installed and configured in your VS Code environment.

## Usage
##### Step 1: Describe Your Theme
- You open Github Copilot in VSCode.

- You type @themer to invoke the AI theme generator.

- Then you describe what you want in plain English.

- It will automatically update your settings. You can ask it for changes if necessary too.

##### Step 2: Theme Generation

- The system uses your description to:

- Parse keywords using CoPilot.

- Map keywords to a predefined color palette.

- Generate a JSON file for the VS Code theme.

##### Step 3: Apply the Theme

- The generated theme will be automatically applied to your VS Code environment.

- You can view or edit the theme in the themes folder of the project directory.

#### Future Enhancements

- Advanced NLP for better understanding of theme descriptions.

- Support for additional IDEs beyond VS Code.

- Integration with online color palette APIs for dynamic color suggestions.
